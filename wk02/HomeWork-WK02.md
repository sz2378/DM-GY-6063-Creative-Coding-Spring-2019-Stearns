# Week 02 Homework:

## Class Review:

Was super excited to see your house drawing skills. After only a week punching away at the keyboard in Processing, we've checked all the boxes.

1. I think we've finally got the GitHub mess sorted out. If you have any conflicts when merging the upstream/master into your branch, take a screen shot and send it to me on slack. Seems like the .gitignore and .DS_Store files are still tirpping us up.
2. Variables, Datatypes, Arrays, Motion Basics, conditionals, if else statments, for loops... holy smokes we covered a lot. Breathe. Play around with the class coding examples.


## Your Assignments

### Readings/Watching

Tehre should be a lot of overlap, so pick whichever method works best for you. Don't do everything, just review, tinker with, and absorb the material.

1. Explore [https://processing.org/reference/](https://processing.org/reference/) (leisurely)
2. Explore the examples in File > Examples > Basics. Focus on Arrays, Control, Data, Math, Input.
3. Read: Learning Processing - Ch. 3 - 4 (intently)
4. Watch: Shiffman, Learning Processing 5-6 (including sub-videos) (for fun!)

### Journal Entries (2)

Generally these will be a place for you to post about cool projects you learn about. To get things started, I'd like you to tell me:

1. What program is that?
 * See something "in the wild" and want to know what software is running behnd the scenes? Share it on your wiki.
2. Challenge yourself.
 * Identify a concept or idea that challenges your coding skills. Write about it and maybe share examples or attempts to express that idea.

### Coding Assignment 2 (part 1)

Draw an environment for a future game. Could be side scrolling or a dungeon style map game, top down, etc. 

1. Make some background art
2. Design and draw game pieces or icons
3. Use motion
4. Use an if statement
5. Accept some form of user input from mouse or keyboard
6. Use a for loop

Tips:

1. It's ok if you don't have an idea. Just start drawing things and see what ideas come to mind.
2. Be open for anything, even if it's crazy!
3. Draw out your ideas to help them come into focus.

Challenge Yourself:

1. See if you can define a region with a shape, and then detect whether the mouse is positioned over it. Give the user some feedback.
2. Set an object in motion and see if you can get it to stay on screen. Detect collision with walls.
3. Set two objects in motion and make them change directions when they come in contact.
